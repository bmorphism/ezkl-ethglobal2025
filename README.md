# ðŸŽµ Agentic Proof-Chaining Framework - Maximal Edition ðŸŽµ

This repository contains the smart contracts, agent code, and documentation for a comprehensive, multi-agent proof-chaining framework using EZKL. It provides the on-chain infrastructure for a new kind of verifiable, multi-agent AI collaboration.

## The Vision: An AI Orchestra

This project enables a "digital orchestra" where autonomous AI agents, each a master of its own "instrument" (a specific neural architecture), can collaborate to perform complex tasks. Their individual contributions are woven together into a single, verifiable "symphony" on the blockchain, all under the direction of a master "conductor."

## ðŸŽ¼ The Architectural Overture

This diagram provides a high-level overview of the entire system, now including the coordination layer.

## ðŸŽ¶ The Proof-Chaining Symphony

This sequence diagram illustrates the full, orchestrated workflow, from agent registration to the completion of a multi-step task.

## ðŸŽ» Meet the Orchestra

Each component in this framework plays a specific role in the overall composition.

*   **The Composers (Python Agents):**
    *   `src/`: The off-chain agents that perform the computations and generate the ZK proofs.

*   **The Concert Hall (Solidity Contracts):**
    *   `contracts/verifiers/`: The individual "instrument sections," each responsible for verifying proofs from a specific AI architecture.
    *   `contracts/coordination/AgentRegistry.sol`: The "musicians' guild," where agents register their capabilities and stake their reputation.
    *   `contracts/coordination/ProofChainOrchestrator.sol`: The "conductor," who directs the entire performance, delegating tasks and ensuring the final composition is coherent.

*   **The Program Notes (Documentation):**
    *   `docs/`: Contains the detailed specifications and guides that explain the theory and structure behind the music.

## Overview

This project provides the on-chain infrastructure for verifiable, multi-agent AI collaboration. It enables autonomous AI agents to prove the integrity of their computational work using zero-knowledge proofs, and to chain these proofs together to perform complex, multi-step tasks.

The core of the framework is a suite of smart contracts that can verify ZK proofs generated by off-chain agents, and an orchestration layer that manages the delegation of tasks and the composition of proofs.

## Live Deployment (Sepolia Testnet)

The core infrastructure is live, deployed, and verified on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

## Architecture

The framework is divided into two main components: the off-chain agents and the on-chain contracts.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Off-Chain Environment"
        A[AI Agent] -- 1. Performs Computation --> B(ML Model)
        B -- 2. Generates ZK Proof --> C((ZK Proof))
    end

    subgraph "On-Chain Environment (Ethereum)"
        C -- 3. Submits Proof --> D{Verifier Contract}
        D -- 4. Verifies Proof --> E[Verification Result]
        D -- 5. Mints Receipt --> F(Computation Receipt)
        F -- 6. Informs --> G[Orchestrator Contract]
    end

```

1.  **Off-Chain Agents:** Responsible for performing computationally intensive tasks (e.g., running an ML model) and generating a ZK proof of that computation using EZKL.
2.  **On-Chain Verifiers:** A suite of Solidity contracts, each specialized to a particular AI architecture, that can verify the correctness of a ZK proof.
3.  **On-Chain Orchestrator:** A central contract that manages the delegation of tasks to agents and the composition of their proofs into a verifiable chain.

## Visualizations & Core Flow

To better understand the flow of data and control through the system, please see the following resources:

*   **`docs/CORE_VERIFIER_FLOW.md`**: A detailed markdown document that explains the step-by-step process of verification.
*   **`scripts/ascii_verifier_flow.py`**: A Python script that generates a simple ASCII art representation of the verifier flow.
*   **`scripts/verifier_flow_visualization.py`**: A Python script that generates a more detailed, graphical visualization of the verifier flow.

---

## End-to-End Demo

To run a complete, end-to-end test of the framework (from proof generation to on-chain verification), use the following command:

```bash
make conduct
```

This will execute a silent, animated orchestration of the entire process, culminating in a single `✓` to confirm that the verification was successful.

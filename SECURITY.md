## Reporting a Vulnerability

The security of this framework is our top priority. We encourage all users and researchers to report any potential security vulnerabilities they discover.

To report a vulnerability, please email us at `security@example.com` with the following information:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any proof-of-concept code or transaction hashes.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and will work with you to ensure the vulnerability is addressed in a timely and responsible manner.

Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it. We appreciate your help in keeping this framework secure.

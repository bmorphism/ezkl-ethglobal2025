# Strategic Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic vision for the Agentic Proof-Chaining Framework, from its current state to its future as a multi-chain ecosystem.

### Phase 1: Foundation Establishment (✅ Complete)
- **Deploy ZK verifier contracts to Sepolia testnet:** The core verifiers for RWKV, Mamba, and xLSTM are live and operational.
- **Implement proof generation and verification:** The off-chain agents can successfully generate proofs that are verifiable on-chain.
- **Create basic proof chaining mechanisms:** The contracts support the linking of computation receipts.
- **Establish contract interfaces and events:** The core API for agent interaction is defined.

### Phase 2: Darkhaven Consolidation (✅ Complete)
- **Implement advanced coordination contracts:** The `AgentRegistry` and `ProofChainOrchestrator` contracts are implemented.
- **Establish a reproducible environment:** A `Dockerfile` and `requirements.lock` file have been created to ensure a consistent development and execution environment.
- **Implement a CI/CD pipeline:** A GitHub Actions workflow automatically verifies the end-to-end functionality of the framework.
- **Formalize project governance:** A `LICENSE`, `SECURITY.md`, and `DESIGN_CHOICES.md` have been added to the repository.

### Phase 3: Incentivization & Consensus (Planned)
- **Deploy to Ethereum mainnet:** The framework will be deployed to the Ethereum mainnet, enabling real-world economic applications.
- **Implement economic incentive mechanisms:** Token-based rewards and penalties will be introduced to incentivize honest and high-quality work, as discussed in the `INCENTIVES` transcript.
- **Create reputation and staking systems:** A robust reputation system will be built on top of the `AgentRegistry` to provide a trust metric for agents.
- **Establish governance protocols:** A decentralized governance system will be created to manage the evolution of the framework, incorporating the consensus-building ideas from the `ETHGLOBAL` transcript.

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion (Future)
- **Multi-chain deployment:** The framework will be deployed to other EVM-compatible chains like Polygon and Arbitrum to reduce costs and increase scalability.
- **Cross-chain proof verification:** The ability to verify proofs across different blockchain networks will be developed.
- **Advanced operad compositions:** The `ProofChainOrchestrator` will be enhanced to support more complex and dynamic task compositions.
- **AI agent marketplace integration:** The framework will be integrated with existing AI agent marketplaces to provide a trust and verification layer.
